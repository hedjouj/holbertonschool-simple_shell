Welcome to our custom `Simple Shell` project! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a simple version of the linux shell made for Holberton School taking part of the "Low-level programming & Algorithm - Linux and Unix system programming" projects.
It is created using the C programming Language and it can do many functionalities that a real shell does.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This custom `printf` implementation allows users to print formatted data to the standard output. It can handle the basic conversion specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, `%i` and `%d`, as well as more advanced ones like `%b`, `%o`, `%x`, `%p`, and a few others.

The key challenge was to replicate the behavior of the standard `printf` function without directly using it.
